# buildspace os

This is a Chromium based browser extension that will replace your browser homepage with a countdown to demo day, upcoming events, and the latest news for nights and weekends.

For now -- you'll need to install this extension manually (stay tuned, this will be in the extension store soon)

## Installation
Install in 30s by watching this video LINK VIDEO

If you've never done this before, don't worry it's super simple. For the instructions we are going to use Chrome, but it should work identical on any Chromium based browser


### 1. Download + extract the extension
On this repo, click the green "Code" button and select Download ZIP. Make sure to save it in a safe spot!<br>

Once you get there you'll see "Developer mode" in the top right. Make sure to toggle that **on** and then you'll see new options (we're gonna be using "Load unpacked")<br>

### 3. Load the extension
You're at the home stretch! Press the "Load unpacked" option and then go to the folder where you extracted buildspace os. It should look something like this:<br>

Once you select it you should see this (nice you did it!)<br>

### 4. Open a new tab
Now you can see this thing in action! Open a new tab and you'll notice that there is a prompt saying that the page was changed by the buildspace os extension. **Make sure to select keep it or the extension will not work.**<br>
